# Base Yield - Token Farm Game

This is a decentralized token farming game built with blockchain smart contracts and a modern web interface.

## Project Structure

This repository contains two main components:

### `/blockchain/` - Smart Contracts
- Solidity smart contracts for token farming mechanics
- Built with Foundry framework
- Includes deployment scripts and configuration

### `/front-end/` - Web Application
A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-onchain --mini`](), configured with:

- [MiniKit](https://docs.base.org/builderkits/minikit/overview)
- [OnchainKit](https://www.base.org/builders/onchainkit)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- Token farming game interface
- Blockchain integration for on-chain interactions

## Getting Started

### Running the Front-end Application

1. Navigate to the front-end directory:
```bash
cd front-end
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

2. Verify environment variables, these will be set up by the `npx create-onchain --mini` command:

You can regenerate the FARCASTER Account Association environment variables by running `npx create-onchain --manifest` in your project directory.

The environment variables enable the following features:

- Frame metadata - Sets up the Frame Embed that will be shown when you cast your frame
- Account association - Allows users to add your frame to their account, enables notifications
- Redis API keys - Enable Webhooks and background notifications for your application by storing users notification details

```bash
# Shared/OnchainKit variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_PROJECT_NAME=
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ICON_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=

# Frame metadata

```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Running the Blockchain Components

For blockchain development and deployment, navigate to the `/blockchain/` directory and follow the instructions in the blockchain-specific README.

## Front-end Features

### Token Farm Game
- Interactive farming game interface
- Plot management and token staking
- Real-time farming progress tracking
- Harvest celebrations and animations
- Ranking system for players

### Blockchain Integration
- Smart contract interactions for farming mechanics
- On-chain token staking and rewards
- Transaction management and status tracking
- Wallet connection and account management

### UI Components
- Modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Custom UI component library
- Mobile-optimized interface
- Dark/light theme support

### MiniKit Integration

### Frame Configuration
- `.well-known/farcaster.json` endpoint configured for Frame metadata and account association
- Frame metadata automatically added to page headers in `layout.tsx`

### Background Notifications
- Redis-backed notification system using Upstash
- Ready-to-use notification endpoints in `api/notify` and `api/webhook`
- Notification client utilities in `lib/notification-client.ts`

### Theming
- Custom theme defined in `theme.css` with OnchainKit variables
- Pixel font integration with Pixelify Sans
- Dark/light mode support through OnchainKit

### MiniKit Provider
The app is wrapped with `MiniKitProvider` in `providers.tsx`, configured with:
- OnchainKit integration
- Access to Frames context
- Sets up Wagmi Connectors
- Sets up Frame SDK listeners
- Applies Safe Area Insets

## Customization

To get started building your own frame, follow these steps:

1. Remove the DemoComponents:
   - Delete `components/DemoComponents.tsx`
   - Remove demo-related imports from `page.tsx`

2. Start building your Frame:
   - Modify `page.tsx` to create your Frame UI
   - Update theme variables in `theme.css`
   - Adjust MiniKit configuration in `providers.tsx`

3. Add your frame to your account:
   - Cast your frame to see it in action
   - Share your frame with others to start building your community
